The easiest way to set up the project is to use the Eclipse Platform, with the Subclipse plugin installed, to get the latest revision from SVN. From there, to run the server you will need to download the Project Darkstar Server available at http://projectdarkstar.com/current-distribution.html.

A jar file of the project must then be copied into the deploy folder, and executed by running the sgs-boot.jar filer in the bin folder. This can be done through the command line with `java -jar bin/sgs-boot.jar`.
