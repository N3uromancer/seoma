game overview:
-gives a rough overview of how the game is structured and how various game details are implemented

attacking:
-whenever a unit attacks, an attack command is created and sent to the server (or client if the attack originated
on the server)
-when a client receives an attack order, it is immediately executed
-attack orders consist of an id denoting the attack unit, and a byte denoting the direction of the attack
-each value of a byte (0-256) is mapped to a degree value from 0-360 when determining direction

TCP receiving:
-important data that must be reliably transfered to either a client or the server is sent via TCP
-when TCP data is received, it is read from the stream and put into a byte buffer to be processed by the operation executor
-the id of the operation must be put at the start of the returned byte buffer after processing by a converter so that the
operation executor knows which operation to perform

UDP receiving:
-UDP for unreliable information, such as unit stats, that gets sent out often
-old data simply thrown out, replaced by newer data
-byte buffers taken from received packets and sent to the operation executor for processing

operation executor:
-processes received data in another thread to allowed receiving threads to take in more data
-reads and removes the first byte from byte buffers being proccessed, first byte always contains the operation to
be performed on the buffer
