pathfinder improvements:

-potential fields for the local planner, not simply a direct line test
-bsp tree for determining closest nodes
-bsp tree for determing closest pathable objects when grouping
-path cutting/trimming to reduce extraneous nodes
-grouping algorithm take into account distances to other objects in the group, will
make groups more clusered/centralize, less spread out
