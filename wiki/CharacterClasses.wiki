= Classes =

== Warrior ==
A strong, defensive, durable close-range fighter with high life and resistances. Should have skills designed for drawing monsters to him and helping him take monster damage with ease. His purpose is to take damage for the party.

== Priest ==
A defensive support class with healing spells, buffs, and debuffs as well as shields and barriers to help keep the party alive.

== Mage ==
A heavily offensive class made for dealing large amounts of damage with magic spells. Consumes large amounts of mana and is very weak and easily killed. Needs protection from monsters to be most effective.

== Summoner ==
His purpose is to create minions and raise pets to give more defense to the party. The pets are disposable and can give protection to nearby party members. He can also raise helpful summons to gather items from the battlefield and scout ahead.

== Ranger ==
Made for dealing large amounts of damage like the Mage, but in physical rather than magical damage. Like the Mage, it can do massive damage to groups of monsters, but is easily killed if unprotected.
