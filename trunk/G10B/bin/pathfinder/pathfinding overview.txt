pathfinding overview:

constructing potential fields for movement of pathable objects:

-the world maintains a partition holding all path obstacle primitives
-path obstacle primimtives are either line segments or circles
-other pathable objects count as path obstacles if their priority is higher than that of the pathable
object moving through the world
-when a region is probed for its potential, a set of relevent path obstacles are first found
-the relevant set is used to determine a potential for the given point based off the distance
from that point to the various objects in the set
-objects are moved through the world always towards points of lower potential than their initial points
