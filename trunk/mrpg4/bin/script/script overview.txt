script overview:

======================================================================

-script files: declare variables and types

======================================================================

-types: used to define how the script can be used by the program

-types declared in scripts reference actual classes in the program that are
extensions of the Type class
-each type can have so many required variables and script files denoting themselves
as of tha type are required to declare the type's variables
-types are used to declare methods for the script files because the type knows
what variables are declared for each script

=======================================================================

advantages of a simple scripting language

-recording variables that have changed is very easy, allowing the program to determine delta
values that need to be sent to other networked programs
-allows game objects to be declared quickly
-allows for easy and intuitive editing of game objects, by full editor or text edit programs
