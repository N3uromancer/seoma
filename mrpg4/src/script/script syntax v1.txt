script syntax:

-lines starting with any of the following ignore characters are skipped when parsing:
		-, =, <, >
-lines that are blank are also skipped
-first line must be "version x", where x is a decimal specifying the version
-variables are declared by writing first the type of variable it is, then the name
of the variable, and then the value of the variable
-variable types:
		boolean, short, double
-each script may have a maximum of 256 variables
-each new line denotes a new expression, thus no semicolons or other expression delineators
are needed
